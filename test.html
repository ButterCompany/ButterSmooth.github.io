<p>Today i learnt about HTML tags. There are some cool things that i can do with HTML. For example, i could <strong>bold</strong> things by using the (strong) tags. <em>Emphasize</em> things by using the (em) tags.</p>

<p>Creating a new paragraph is as easy as a pea. We can just use the (p) tags. <br>Making the new sentence into a new line uses the (br) tags.</p>

<p>(br),(img) and (hr) tags are empty tags. We do not need to close them.</p>

<p>Targets can be used in html hyperlink.<br>(_blank) leads to the link opening to a new tab. <br>(_self) leads to the link opening inside the existing tab.</p>

<p>Here is a special picture for this victorious occasion.<br>
