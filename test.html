			Everything about here would be my progress in HTML. If you do not like to stay on this page any longer, you can press ctrl+W to close the tab. Alternatively, you could click <a href="javascript:window.open('','_self').close();">here</a>.

			Hyperlink text can be opened in 2 types. It can be opened in a new tab or in the current tab. To target it, you just need to add [target="_self/_blank]. By using _self it stands for opening the link in the existing tag. By using _blank it stands for opening the link in a new tab.

			HTML can be styled in many ways using the style properties. Those are the following ones that are the most important. [text-align:(centre,left,right);] and [background-color:(colorshere);] and [color:(colorshere)] and [font-family:(fontname);]. A thing to note is that background-colors is like the background of the page and colors is the color of the text.
